# React Food Menu with 2-page 3D Effect

A recap of the original food menu exercise in Module 2 provided by Sigma School.

## Overview

Initially the exercise presented was just to create a nicely presented food menu. But I wanted to add some dimensional depth to the food-menu (as what you would have real life). Upon click event anywhere on the document, the menu will turn rightwards to display the back-page. 

I realized how lacking my css was as I was struggling to implement a transition effect. Nevertheless, it was a fruitful project as it taught me meaningful ways to structure my content and css to make it possible.
